# Bootstrap Website

In this exercise, we will take a website without any CSS or special formatting, and use Bootstrap to format and structure each page.

1. Download the files to your computer. There are three HTML files for you to work with, and a folder that includes the same files, but includes Bootstrap formatting. You can use these files if you get stuck.

2. Open the <a href="https://github.com/LibraryCodeLab/BootstrapWebsite/blob/master/index.html">index.html</a> file in your text editor (such as <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>) and open it in the browser as well. As we make changes, we will save our html file in our text editor and refresh it in the browser.

3. First, we need to add in the Bootstrap code. Go to <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap.com</a> and copy the code that will go in between the <b>head</b> tags of your html doc.

4. Save your <a href="https://github.com/LibraryCodeLab/BootstrapWebsite/blob/master/index.html">index.html</a> doc and refresh it in the browser. Notice what has changed, just by inserting the Bootstrap code. Insert the same code in your <a href="https://github.com/LibraryCodeLab/BootstrapWebsite/blob/master/govt.html">govt.html</a> file and your <a href="https://github.com/LibraryCodeLab/BootstrapWebsite/blob/master/neighborhoods.html">neighborhoods.html</a> file.

*Before you get started, review <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_class.asp">CSS Classes</a>, and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_div.asp">HTML divs</a>, as these tools will help you connect your Bootstrap formatting.

5. Use the "container" class to wrap your content. What does this change on your page? <a href="https://www.quackit.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_4/tutorial/bootstrap_containers.cfm"><em>More about Bootstrap Containers</em></a>

6. Next, use the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid System</a> to rearrange your content and make it appear more similar to the website this practice is based on: <a href="www.welcomeclt.org">WelcomeCLT.org</a>.

7. Use the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/">Bootstrap Navbar</a> to spruce up your menu navigation.

8. Use the grid system to change your <a href="https://github.com/LibraryCodeLab/BootstrapWebsite/blob/master/neighborhoods.html">neighborhood.html</a> file and make three columns--one for each neighborhood.

9. Use the grid system to arrange your pictures on the <a href="https://github.com/LibraryCodeLab/BootstrapWebsite/blob/master/govt.html">govt.html</a> page to have 2 rows of 6.
 
10. Using <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/">Bootstrap.com</a> as a reference, make other cosmetic changes to your site. For example, <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/">buttons</a>, and the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/jumbotron/">jumbotron</a> class.
