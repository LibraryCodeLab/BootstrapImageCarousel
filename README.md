# Bootstrap Website

In this exercise, we will take a website without any CSS or special formatting, and use Bootstrap to format and structure each page.

1. Download the files to your computer. There are three HTML files for you to work with, and a folder that includes the same files, but includes Bootstrap formatting. You can use these files if you get stuck.
2. Open the index.html file in your text editor (such as <a href="www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a>) and open it in the browser as well. As we make changes, we will save our html file in our text editor and refresh it in the browser.
3. First, we need to add in the Bootstrap code. Go to <a href="www.bootstrap.com">Bootstrap.com</a> and copy the code that will go in between the <head> tags of your html doc.
