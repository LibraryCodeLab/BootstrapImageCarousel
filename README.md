# Bootstrap Image Carousel

1. In your HTML file, look for things you recognize. There is a lot of probably unfamiliar things in your file, but start by finding the things you do recognize. Find at least 5 things you understand.

2. Find the line of code that looks like this:

 <blockquote><script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script></blockquote>
 <br>

Copy and paste that link into your browser to see all the code that is being referenced (it's a lot).

3. In your browser, notice how the file is rendering. Why are your images not showing up?

4. Find 4 images (on the web) and download them.  Make sure the files download into the same folder as your HTML file. Once you've downloaded them, change your HTML code to link to your new image files. Refresh your browser to check your work.

5. Change the headers and paragraphs to accurately reflect your new images. Refresh your browser to check your work.

6. Open up the carousel.js file in your text editor. This is a downloaded file from getbootstrap.com specifically related to the image carousel you just created. Notice all the code that is ready-made for you, and how much JavaScript you can use without needing to write the code yourself.
